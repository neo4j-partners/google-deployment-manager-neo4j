## Packer Images for Google Compute Engine
  
## Dependencies

* `brew install packer`
* Install `gcloud` cloud CLI and authenticate
* Gcloud service account JSON credentials

There is a service account there called `packer-sa` which is used
for this process.  Credentials are stored in `packer-sa.json` which isn't in
git for obvious reasons.  Gain access to the google project and grab a key, or
contact <david.allen@neo4j.com> for access.

## Build Neo4j Enterprise Image

You should specify edition (community/enterprise) and version.  Because this is
ubuntu based,versions should match what is in the debian package repo.  Watch 
out because of recent package naming, if you want v4.3.6, you need to install
`1:4.3.6`.

You may omit the AWS key variables and set them in your environment.

```
packer build \
    -var "neo4j_edition=enterprise" \
    -var "neo4j_version=1:4.3.6" \
    packer-template.json
```

Check the variables at the top of the JSON file for other options you can override/set.

Images go to the `launcher-development-191917` project on GCP.

## License Image and Copy to Public Project

Images above are placed in non-public project because they're in staging, also also because the public project for security reasons has no compute quota, and so images cannot be built there.

Additionally, we have to use a google-provided python script to tag
license metadata to the image in order to make it acceptable for the
launcher marketplace.  Licenses in the end aren't legal documents on GCP, they're
basically API resources that get tagged to images for tracking purposes.

Marketplace updates that are submitted, referencing non-licensed images will be rejected.

To perform these steps, use the `copy-to-public.sh` shell script, and follow
its required parameters.

[GCP documentation on creating licensed images](https://cloud.google.com/launcher/docs/partners/technical-components#create_the_base_solution_vm) for reference.  The scripts above encapsulate that advice though, and automate it.

## Test Public Image

See the test directory at the top of the repo for scripts which will do this.

### Check that license metadata is present.  

Note that licenses contains our entry.  Here's what good metadata looks like:

```
$ gcloud compute images describe neo4j-enterprise-1-4-3-6-apoc-bloom --project launcher-public
archiveSizeBytes: '830832128'
creationTimestamp: '2018-03-29T06:15:32.483-07:00'

```

### Create an instance of the public image in some test project:

```
gcloud compute instances create my-neo4j-instance \
    --image neo4j-enterprise-1-4-3-6 \
    --tags neo4j \
    --image-project launcher-public
```

### Test the Launcher Entry with the image

Adjust `vmImage` in `neo4j-causal-cluster.jinja` and test deploy the new setup.  This
allows testing of causal clusters with this config, with any number of nodes.
