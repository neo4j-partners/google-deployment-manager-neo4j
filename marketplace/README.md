# marketplace

As an end user, you should have little use for the contents of this directory and almost certainly want to either use the Marketplace listing directly or [simple](../simple/).  If you're a Neo4j employee, updating the Google Marketplace listing, these notes may be helpful.

## Updating the Listing
To submit an updated listing, simply run ./makeArchive.sh and then submit the resulting zip to the Partner Portal [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/partner/solutions?project=launcher-public).
