  tagline: Neo4j Enterprise Edition
  descriptionHtml: >-
    <p>Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an
    ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications. The Enterprise
    Edition includes all that Community Edition has to offer, plus extra
    enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover
    abilities.</p><p>Neo4j is referred to as a native graph database because it
    efficiently implements the property graph model down to the storage level.
    This means that the data is stored exactly as you whiteboard it, and the
    database uses pointers to navigate and traverse the graph. In contrast to
    graph processing or in-memory libraries, Neo4j also provides full database
    characteristics, including ACID transaction compliance, cluster support, and
    runtime failover â€“ making it suitable to use graphs for data in production
    scenarios.</p>
