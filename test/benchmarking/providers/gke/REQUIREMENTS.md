# Requirements for the GKE provider

You need:

- A pre-existing k8s cluster
- Kubectl that's already configured and ready to go auth'd against that cluster
- The Google GKE "Application" CRD installed
- Access to the staging repository for Neo4j's GKE instances

If you're missing any of these and want to run this provider, contact David Allen.
